              In this project made here, you will be able to know the temperature, wind speed, sky condition, etc. First I created a box that contains an input box. If you input the name of any city in the input box, you will get all the information.
              
              You will see all the information in another box. With the help of this simple weather application, you can easily know the weather of any city in the world."

If a mandatory input field name exists, the user can type a number, leave the field blank, type only one letter, and so on. All of these validations are simple to implement using JavaScript. Letâ€™s look at an example of a simple form validation project. HTML elements will be required as well, as is customary."
